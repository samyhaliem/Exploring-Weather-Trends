## Exploring Weather Trends
This project analyzes historical weather data to compare local and global temperature trends. The city of Cairo, Egypt, is used as the local dataset.

## Project Overview
In this project, we explore the relationship between local temperature trends in Cairo and global temperature trends. Using data extracted through SQL queries and analyzed in Excel, we visualize the long-term trends using moving averages.

## Key Findings
Temperature Trends: Over the past century, both Cairo and the global temperatures have shown an upward trend.
Cairo vs. Global: Cairo's temperatures have consistently exceeded the global average.
Positive Correlation: A positive correlation of 0.58267 between local and global temperature trends.
## Tools Used
SQL: Extracted data from the Udacity SQL Workspace.
Excel: Used for data arrangement, moving average calculations, and visualization.
## Dataset
Global and city-level temperature datasets were obtained from the Udacity Classroom SQL Workspace.
Moving averages were applied to smooth out daily fluctuations and highlight long-term trends.
## How to Run the Analysis
# Data Extraction: Use SQL queries to extract global and local temperature data.
# Data Preparation: Organize the data using Excel or another spreadsheet tool.
# Data Visualization: Generate line charts and calculate moving averages to observe trends.
## Conclusion
The project confirms the rising trend in global and local temperatures, with Cairo consistently recording higher temperatures than the global average. This project demonstrates how moving averages can help visualize long-term climate trends.
